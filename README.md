This repository is about a project I made using the GOT_OCR 2.0 model available on Hugging Face that has a state-of the-art 95% accuracy in Optical Character Recognition tasks.
The model has been integrated with a basic search feature for keyword searching and has been deployed on Gradio web interface.
The main part of this project has been the pre-processing part where the extracted OCR text had to undergo extreme cleaning and pre-processing to be made readable to the reader.
